This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in F# related to the unexpected behavior of mutable variables when used in functions and when combining lists. The `bug.fs` file shows the erroneous code where swapping variables and combining lists using mutable variables don't behave as might be expected from other languages. The solution is in `bugSolution.fs` and demonstrates how to achieve the desired results in F#.
